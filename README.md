This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Security Notes

See `SECURITY.md` for details.

This project uses the `xlsx` package (`0.18.5`), which has known advisories (e.g. CVE-2023-30533, CVE-2024-22363).
For this assignment, XLSX handling is intentionally **trusted-local only**:
- Only the bundled `data/example.xlsx` is read/written (no uploads, no user-controlled paths).
- Sheet names and A1 ranges are validated strictly.
- Ranges are capped (see `MAX_RANGE_CELLS` in `src/lib/xlsx/range.ts`).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
